This repo contains an analysis of Seattle Road Conditions for the final report for DATA512. We compare the road quality and data availability of road quality across different regions of Seattle. Through this analysis, we find most regions of Seattle have similar road quality conditions with the exception of E and Central District, which have worse road conditions.

The background, motivation, analysis and code are available in "Data512 Final Project Notebook.ipynb".

The raw code used for this assignment is in Seattle_Streets.csv, which was pulled from [data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com](http://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/383027d103f042499693da22d72d10e3_0?geometry=-122.534%2C47.563%2C-122.097%2C47.644&page=2&selectedAttribute=PVMTCONDINDX1) on November 22, 2018. This data is available for public use, with more information on data and licensing in the ipynb notebook.
